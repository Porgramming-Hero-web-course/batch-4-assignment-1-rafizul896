# How to Handle Asynchronous Operations Using Async/Await Over Callback/Promise in TypeScript

In modern JavaScript and TypeScript development, handling asynchronous operations efficiently is crucial. Asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from APIs or reading files, can lead to cleaner, more readable code when properly managed. TypeScript provides excellent support for asynchronous operations, particularly with the use of `async` and `await`. This blog post explores why `async/await` is preferred over traditional callback and promise approaches and how to use it effectively in TypeScript.

## Why Use Async/Await Over Callbacks and Promises?

Callbacks were the original way to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript, but they quickly led to complex and hard-to-maintain "callback hell." Promises improved the readability of asynchronous code by flattening it, but chaining multiple `.then()` calls can still become confusing. `Async/await` takes asynchronous handling a step further by making the code look and behave like synchronous code, which is easier to read and debug.

### Key Benefits of Async/Await:
1. **Simplicity**: Async/await syntax allows asynchronous code to read in a straightforward, linear manner.
2. **Error Handling**: Async/await lets you use try/catch for error handling, providing a consistent approach similar to synchronous code.
3. **TypeScript Compatibility**: Async/await works seamlessly with TypeScript's static typing, making it easier to catch errors at compile time.

## Basics of Async/Await in TypeScript

To use async/await, you mark a function as `async`. This allows you to use `await` within the function to pause execution until a promise is resolved. Here's an example:

```typescript
 const fetchData = async(url: string): Promise<any> => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
        throw error;
    }
}
